## Description
Using the inquirer module and mysql, create an employee tracking system.  This system, at a minimum, should allow a user to add departments, roles, employees; view departments, roles, employees, and update employee roles.  For a bonus, add the ability to update an employee's managers, view employees by manager, and delete departments, roles, and employees.  Additionally, create a 'report' that shows the total salaries in a department.

NPM Modules used are inquirer, mysql, figlet

## Installation
